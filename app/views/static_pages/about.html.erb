        <h1>Mission</h1>

        <p class="lead-paragraph">Spliddit is a not-for-profit academic endeavor. Its mission is twofold:</p>
        
        <ul class="steps">
            <li>To provide easy access to carefully designed fair division methods, thereby making the world a bit fairer.</li>
            <li>To communicate to the public the beauty and value of theoretical research in computer science, mathematics, and economics, from an unusual perspective.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h1>Fairness Guarantees</h1>
        <p>
            When we say that we guarantee a fairness property, we are stating a mathematical fact. In other words, there are formal proofs showing that each of our algorithms provides rigorous fairness guarantees. The surprising possibility of formulating fairness in mathematical terms is the beauty of the scientific field of fair division, and the force behind Spliddit.
